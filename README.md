# daburu-angular-cmp-npm

This is a template project containing the elements we need to build projects that produce npm modules containing reusable Angular components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Publish

Run `npm publish` to publish the module.

## Testing

### Running unit tests

We can execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

In this project, you can run the tests once (that is to say, without watching for file changes) by running `npm test`.  To leave the browser open and watch for changes, run `ng test` directly.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### For More on Testing...

This template doesn't include every possible testing trick, but there's a lot of information in the [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/guide/testing).

## Security and SonarTS

This `tslint.json` file in this project extends the [SonarTs](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/codeanalyzers/sonarts.html#_) linter.

From the [SonarSource] (https://www.sonarsource.com/) website:

> SonarSource delivers what is probably the best static code analyzer you can find on the market for TypeScript. Based on Microsoft open-source TypeScript compiler front-end, it uses the most advanced techniques (pattern matching, program flow analysis) to analyze code and find code smells, bugs and security vulnerabilities.

You can also install the [SonarQube Community Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7238-sonarqube-community-plugin) for Webstorm.
